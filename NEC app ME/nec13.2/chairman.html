        <h1>CHAIRMAN'S PROFILE</h1>
        <p> 
			
			Dr. P. Narayana was born in 1957 in Nellore. His father is Mr. P. Subbaramaiah. It could be said that he is a man with the Midas touch. Though he 					            hails from humble beginnings, there has been no looking back for him and whatever he touched turned gold. He graduated and honoured with Gold Medal            in Statistics in 1977 and took a postgraduate degree in the same discipline in 1979 from S. V. University, Tirupathi . All through his student            life, he had been basking in the sunshine of glory and popularity because of his dynamic leadership qualities, intellectual prowess, sweetness of            temper and oratorical talents.</p>
